## About

This dashboard utilizes the capabilities of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to offer a smooth and engaging interface for the exploration and examination of data derived from our website. The visual representations are driven by the Chart.js library, thereby augmenting our capacity to grasp trends and patterns inherent in the data.
